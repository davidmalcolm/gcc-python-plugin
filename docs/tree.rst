gcc.Tree and its subclasses
===========================

The various language front-ends for GCC emit "tree" structures (which I believe
are actually graphs), used throughout the rest of the internal representation of
the code passing through GCC.

.. py:class:: gcc.Tree

   A ``gcc.Tree`` is a wrapper around GCC's `tree` type

   .. py:method:: debug()

      Dump the tree to stderr, using GCC's own diagnostic routines

   .. py:attribute:: type

      Instance of :py:class:`gcc.Tree` giving the type of the node

   .. py:attribute:: addr

     (long) The address of the underlying GCC object in memory

   The __str__ method is implemented using GCC's own pretty-printer for trees,
   so e.g.::

      str(t)

   might return::

      'int <T531> (int, char * *)'

   for a `gcc.FunctionDecl`

   .. py:attribute:: str_no_uid

      A string representation of this object, like str(), but without
      including any internal UIDs.

      This is intended for use in selftests that compare output against some
      expected value, to avoid embedding values that change into the expected
      output.

      For example, given the type declaration above, where `str(t)` might
      return::

         'int <T531> (int, char * *)'

      where the UID "531" is liable to change from compile to compile, whereas
      `t.str_no_uid` has value::

         'int <Txxx> (int, char * *)'

      which won't arbitrarily change each time.

There are numerous subclasses of :py:class:`gcc.Tree`, some with numerous
subclasses of their own.  Some important parts of the class hierarchy include:

==================================   =======================================
Subclass                             Meaning
==================================   =======================================
:py:class:`gcc.Binary`               A binary arithmetic expression, with
                                     numerous subclasses
:py:class:`gcc.Block`                A symbol-binding block
:py:class:`gcc.Comparison`           A relational operators (with various
                                     subclasses)
:py:class:`gcc.Constant`             Subclasses for constants
:py:class:`gcc.Constructor`          An aggregate value (e.g. in C, a
                                     structure or array initializer)
:py:class:`gcc.Declaration`          Subclasses relating to declarations
                                     (variables, functions, etc)
:py:class:`gcc.Expression`           Subclasses relating to expressions
:py:class:`gcc.IdentifierNode`       A name
:py:class:`gcc.Reference`            Subclasses for relating to reference to
                                     storage (e.g. pointer values)
:py:class:`gcc.SsaName`              A variable reference for SSA analysis
:py:class:`gcc.Statement`            Subclasses for statement expressions,
                                     which have side-effects
:py:class:`gcc.Type`                 Subclasses for describing the types of
                                     variables
:py:class:`gcc.Unary`                Subclasses for unary arithmetic
                                     expressions
==================================   =======================================

.. note::

   Each subclass of :py:class:`gcc.Tree` is typically named
   after either one of the `enum tree_code_class` or `enum tree_code` values,
   with the names converted to Camel Case:

   For example a :py:class:`gcc.Binary` is a wrapper around a `tree` of type
   `tcc_binary`, and  a :py:class:`gcc.PlusExpr` is a wrapper around a `tree`
   of type `PLUS_EXPR`.

   As of this writing, only a small subset of the various fields of the different
   subclasses have been wrapped yet, but it's generally easy to add new ones.  To
   add new fields, I've found it easiest to look at `gcc/tree.h` and
   `gcc/print-tree.c` within the GCC source tree and use the `print_node` function
   to figure out what the valid fields are.  With that information, you should
   then look at `generate-tree-c.py`, which is the code that generates the Python
   wrapper classes (it's used when building the plugin to create
   `autogenerated-tree.c`).  Ideally when exposing a field to Python you should
   also add it to the API documentation, and add a test case.

.. py:function:: gccutils.pformat(tree)

   This function attempts to generate a debug dump of a :py:class:`gcc.Tree`
   and all of its "interesting" attributes, recursively.  It's loosely modelled
   on Python's `pprint` module and GCC's own `debug_tree` diagnostic routine
   using indentation to try to show the structure.

   It returns a string.

   It differs from :py:meth:`gcc.Tree.debug()` in that it shows the Python
   wrapper objects, rather than the underlying GCC data structures
   themselves.  For example, it can't show attributes that haven't been
   wrapped yet.

   Objects that have already been reported within this call are abbreviated
   to "..." to try to keep the output readable.

   Example output::

.. py:function:: gccutils.pprint(tree)

   Similar to :py:meth:`gccutils.pformat()`, but prints the output to stdout.

   (should this be stderr instead? probably should take a stream as an arg, but
   what should the default be?)


Blocks
------

.. py:class:: gcc.Block

   A symbol binding block, such as the global symbols within a compilation unit.

   .. py:attribute:: vars

      The list of :py:class:`gcc.Tree` for the declarations and labels in this
      block

Declarations
------------

.. py:class:: gcc.Declaration

   A subclass of :py:class:`gcc.Tree` indicating a declaration

   Corresponds to the `tcc_declaration` value of `enum tree_code_class` within

   .. py:attribute:: location

      The :py:class:`gcc.Location` for this declaration

   .. py:attribute:: is_artificial

      (bool) Is this declaration a compiler-generated entity, rather than
      one provided by the user?

      An example of such an "artificial" declaration occurs within the
      arguments of C++ methods: the initial `this` argument is a
      compiler-generated :py:class:`gcc.ParmDecl`.

   .. py:attribute:: is_builtin

      (bool) Is this declaration a compiler-builtin?

.. py:class:: gcc.FieldDecl

         namespace Example {
             struct Coord {
                 int x;
                 int y;
             };

             class Widget {
             public:
                 void set_location(const struct Coord& coord);
             };

   will hold the return value from a function.

.. py:class:: gcc.VarDecl

   A subclass of :py:class:`gcc.Declaration` indicating the declaration of a
   variable (e.g. a global or a local).

   .. py:attribute:: initial

      The initial value for this variable as a :py:class:`gcc.Constructor`,
      or None

   .. py:attribute:: static

      (boolean) Is this variable to be allocated with static storage?

.. py:class:: gcc.NamespaceDecl

   A subclass of :py:class:`gcc.Declaration` representing a C++ namespace

Types
-----

.. py:class:: gcc.Type

   A subclass of `gcc.Tree` indicating a type

   Corresponds to the `tcc_type` value of `enum tree_code_class` within
   GCC's own C sources.

   .. py:attribute:: name

      The :py:class:`gcc.IdentifierNode` for the name of the type, or `None`.

   .. py:attribute:: pointer

      The :py:class:`gcc.PointerType` representing the `(this_type *)` type

   .. py:attribute:: attributes

      The user-defined attributes on this type (using GCC's `__attribute`
      syntax), as a dictionary (mapping from attribute names to list of
      values).  Typically this will be the empty dictionary.

   .. py:attribute:: sizeof

      `sizeof()` this type, as an `int`, or raising `TypeError` for those
      types which don't have a well-defined size

   The standard C types are accessible via class methods of :py:class:`gcc.Type`.
   They are only created by GCC after plugins are loaded, and so they're
   only visible during callbacks, not during the initial run of the code.
   (yes, having them as class methods is slightly clumsy).

   Each of the following returns a :py:class:`gcc.Type` instance representing
   the given type (or None at startup before any passes, when the types don't
   yet exist)

      =============================  =====================
      Class method                   C Type
      =============================  =====================
      gcc.Type.void()                `void`

      gcc.Type.uint64()              `uint64`
      =============================  =====================

.. py:class:: gcc.IntegerType

   Subclass of :py:class:`gcc.Type`, adding a few properties:

   .. py:attribute:: unsigned

      (Boolean) True for 'unsigned', False for 'signed'

   .. py:attribute:: precision

      (int) The precision of this type in bits, as an int (e.g. 32)

   .. py:attribute:: signed_equivalent

      The gcc.IntegerType for the signed version of this type

   .. py:attribute:: unsigned_equivalent

      The gcc.IntegerType for the unsigned version of this type

   .. py:attribute:: max_value

      The maximum possible value for this type, as a
      :py:class:`gcc.IntegerCst`

   .. py:attribute:: min_value

      The minimum possible value for this type, as a
      :py:class:`gcc.IntegerCst`

.. py:class:: gcc.FloatType

   Subclass of :py:class:`gcc.Type` representing C's `float` and `double` types

   .. py:attribute:: precision

      (int) The precision of this type in bits (32 for `float`; 64 for
      `double`)

.. py:class:: gcc.PointerType

   Subclass of :py:class:`gcc.Type` representing a pointer type, such as
   an `int *`

   .. py:attribute:: dereference

      The :py:class:`gcc.Type` that this type points to.  In the above
      example (`int *`), this would be the `int` type.

.. py:class:: gcc.ArrayType

   Subclass of :py:class:`gcc.Type` representing an array type.  For example,
   in a C declaration such as::

      char buf[16]

   we have a :py:class:`gcc.VarDecl` for `buf`, and its type is an instance of
   :py:class:`gcc.ArrayType`, representing `char [16]`.

   .. py:attribute:: dereference

      The :py:class:`gcc.Type` that this type points to.  In the above
      example, this would be the `char` type.

   .. py:attribute:: range

      The :py:class:`gcc.Type` that represents the range of the
      array's indices.  If the array has a known range, then this will
      ordinarily be an :py:class:`gcc.IntegerType` whose `min_value`
      and `max_value` are the (inclusive) bounds of the array.  If the
      array does not have a known range, then this attribute will be
      `None`.

      That is, in the example above, `range.min_val` is `0`, and
      `range.max_val` is `15`.

      But, for a C declaration like::

         extern char array[];

      the type's `range` would be `None`.

.. py:class:: gcc.VectorType

   .. py:attribute:: dereference

      The :py:class:`gcc.Type` that this type points to

Additional attributes for various :py:class:`gcc.Type` subclasses:

   .. py:attribute:: const

      (Boolean) Does this type have the `const` modifier?

   .. py:attribute:: const_equivalent

      The :py:class:`gcc.Type` for the `const` version of this type

   .. py:attribute:: volatile

      (Boolean) Does this type have the `volatile` modifier?

   .. py:attribute:: volatile_equivalent

      The :py:class:`gcc.Type` for the `volatile` version of this type

   .. py:attribute:: restrict

      (Boolean) Does this type have the `restrict` modifier?

   .. py:attribute:: restrict_equivalent

      The :py:class:`gcc.Type` for the `restrict` version of this type


.. py:class:: gcc.FunctionType

   Subclass of :py:class:`gcc.Type` representing the type of a given function
   (or or a typedef to a function type, e.g. for callbacks).

   See also :py:class:`gcc.FunctionType`

   The `type` attribute holds the return type.

   .. py:attribute:: argument_types

      A tuple of :py:class:`gcc.Type` instances, representing the function's
      argument types

   .. py:function:: gccutils.get_nonnull_arguments(funtype)

      This is a utility function for working with the `"nonnull"` custom
      attribute on function types:

      http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html

      Return a `frozenset` of 0-based integers, giving the arguments for
      which we can assume "nonnull-ness", handling the various cases of:

          * the attribute isn't present (returning the empty frozenset)

          * the attribute is present, without args (all pointer args are
            non-NULL)

          * the attribute is present, with a list of 1-based argument indices
            (Note that the result is still 0-based)

.. py:class:: gcc.MethodType

   Subclass of :py:class:`gcc.Type` representing the type of a given method.
   Similar to :py:class:`gcc.FunctionType`

   You can look up C structures by looking within the top-level
   :py:class:`gcc.Block` within the current translation unit.  For example,
   given this sample C code:

    .. literalinclude:: ../tests/examples/c/struct/input.c
      :lines: 20-30
      :language: c

  then the following Python code:

    .. literalinclude:: ../tests/examples/c/struct/script.py
      :lines: 21-40

  will generate this output:

    .. literalinclude:: ../tests/examples/c/struct/stdout.txt
