These are things we planned, but didn't get done, yet.

buttons:
    
    Should add the "selected" style to the annotations, allowing the user to
    step through them.

report selection:

    Figure out which report is visible, and make the buttons control *that*
    report if more than one report is visible, use the previous selection.
    Change selection when clicking report links as well.

annotation clicking:

    Clicking an annotation makes it selected, until clicking the selected
    event.  Users can use this to stop stepping through notes as well.

alignment of notes:

    When selecting a note, it should line up with the line it's annotating.
    Move the "states" pane up and down, and make sure the overflow is clipped.
    There may be some jquery plugins that will make this much easier.

more data:

    When a state is selected, we could apply mouseovers to variables that show
    their value within that state.
